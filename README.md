## I'm working on this noncommercial project to get more experience in npm oriented development.

I don't have clear plan now.
So plan will be constracted in dynamic way (issues block), and then all ideas will be implemented by myself (or any contributor who ready to invest their time into this project)

### Common steps to reproduce

```
npm i -D concurrently
```

### Commands (can be checked in the `package.json` file)

```
npm run dev
```
